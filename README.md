Hi, I am Uddeshya, 3rd year BSMS student at Indian institute of Science Education and Research, Tirupati, India.I am majoring in Biology, i am deeply interested in Molecular biology, Bioinformatics and Computational approach towards Biology.I started solving Rosalind in December 2020, just after i finished my iGEM project. So i am sharing with you my solutions and projects. Mostly, I use python programming but i am alongside learning Julia programming language, just because it is more suitable for scientific computing.
I am also doing projects in AI and Machine learning as a part of my college curricullum and will be sharing the same in file: data scienceII.
